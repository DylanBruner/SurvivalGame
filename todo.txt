- manage saves from in game: delete, upgrade/repair*, rename, copy
  * upgrade/repair will repair the save if it is corrupted, or upgrade it to the latest version if it is an older version and is missing some data
- add ennemies
- add more things to build with
- crafting system
- add items (weapons, armor, tools, consumables, etc)
- better UI
- better random generation
- possibly more inventory slots, not just the hotbar
- health bar & health system
- stamina bar & stamina system
- actual assets
- title screen art
- full screen support
- rebinding of keys in the options menu
- a difficulty setting
- particles :D [DONE]
- fix movement so that it's not forced to snap to the grid
- foliage so we can actually see ourself moving

Things that would be cool to have but are not a priority:
- biomes
- multiplayer (probably not going to happen)
