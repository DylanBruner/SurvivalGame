[TODO LIST (but done!!)]
- stamina bar & stamina system [DONE]
- fix movement so that it's not forced to snap to the grid [DONE]
- particles :D [DONE]
- make movement not SUCK [DONE]
- lighting... this will be hard [DONE] (wasn't that hard)
- borderless full screen support [KINDA] (doesn't support borderless fullscreen)
- health bar & health system [KINDA] [no way to regen atm]
- move code out of gameview.py to other files [DONE]
- money [DONE]
- player character selector [DONE]
- fix not being able to interact with some tiles depending on how the mouse is positioned on it [DONE]
- fix trees rendering or maybe it's the random gen idk [DONE]


[TODO LIST] (somewhat in order of priority)
- collisions
- make a debugging system that tracks how long parts of game logic are taking, for debugging bad FPS
 - done, make the minimap not suck
- add ennemies
- surviors that randomly spawn in the world
  - they can be hostile or friendly
  - if they're friendly they can give you quests, buy items and sell items to you
- add more resources to mine, loot, craft, build with, etc.
- add items (weapons, armor, tools, consumables, etc)
- possibly more inventory slots, not just the hotbar
- random gen structures & maybe structure groups (like a village in Minecraft)
  - loot chests / chests in general
- better random generation
- manage saves from in game: delete, upgrade/repair*, rename, copy
  - upgrade / repair is supported, just needs a nice way to do it as it's currently just a hotkey
- crafting system (i don't want a Minecraft-esque crafting system, but it would be really easy to implement)
- fix the minimap / come up with a design for it
- better UI (button textures, menu art (stolen ofc), etc)
- a difficulty setting
  - blood moons can be disabled by the config but there's no way to do it in game yet
- foliage so we can actually see ourself moving
  - trees have been added, but some more things like: flowers and bushes would be nice
- actual assets
- title screen art
- more sounds
- better block break sound
- settings menu
  - rebinding of keys, the game already supports this but there's no interface for it yet
  - volume sliders
  - particle quality
- custom world size selectable when creating a new world
- fix delayed sounds
- optimize rendering so we can get 60+ fps in fullscreen not just the default window size
- periodic saving / save the game as a backup if a crash is detected or at least try to


Things that would be cool to have but are not a priority:
- biomes
- multiplayer (probably not going to happen)
  - I could just sync the world data between the games, it seems like it could be a really easy 
    way to do it.
