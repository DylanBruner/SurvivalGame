[TODO LIST (but done!!)]
- stamina bar & stamina system [DONE]
- fix movement so that it's not forced to snap to the grid [DONE]
- particles :D [DONE]
- make movement not SUCK [DONE]
- lighting... this will be hard [DONE] (wasn't that hard)
- full screen support [KINDA] (doesn't support borderless fullscreen)
- health bar & health system [KINDA] [no way to regen atm]
- move code out of gameview.py to other files [DONE]
- money [DONE]
- player character selector [DONE]
- fix not being able to interact with some tiles depending on how the mouse is positioned on it [DONE]
- fix trees rendering or maybe it's the random gen idk [DONE]
- actual assets [DONE]
- make a debugging system that tracks how long parts of game logic are taking, for debugging bad FPS [DONE]
- possibly more inventory slots, not just the hotbar [DONE]
- crafting system (i don't want a Minecraft-esque crafting system, but it would be really easy to implement) [DONE]
- random gen structures [DONE]
  - loot chests / chests in general
- periodic saving in the background [DONE]
- better random generation [DONE]
- item lore [DONE]
- make item lore cache so we don't need to re-generate it every time (kills FPS a bit) [DONE]

[TODO LIST] (somewhat in order of priority)
- fix chests not saving their contents if they were placed by the player
- fix chests not loading the first time they are clicked, (it works if you re-open the chest)
- surviors that randomly spawn in the world
  - they can be hostile or friendly
  - if they're friendly they can give you quests, buy items and sell items to you
- add more resources to mine, loot, craft, build with, etc.
- add items (weapons, armor, tools, consumables, etc)
- collisions
- make the minimap not suck FPS wise
- add enemies
- fix main menus not resizing when the window is resized
- more efficient particle system, calculate a random velocity/heading for each particle once at the start and stick with that
- manage saves from in game: delete, upgrade/repair*, rename, copy
  - upgrade / repair is supported, just needs a nice way to do it as it's currently just a hotkey
- better UI (button textures, menu art (stolen ofc), etc)
- a difficulty setting
  - blood moons can be disabled by the config but there's no way to do it in game yet
- foliage so we can actually see ourself moving
  - trees have been added, but some more things like: flowers and bushes would be nice
- title screen art
- more sounds
- make tiles have the propper size inside the hotbar
- add a way to resize the world tiles & player character during runtime
- better block break sound/different sounds for different blocks
- settings menu
  - rebinding of keys, the game already supports this but there's no interface for it yet
  - changing the language
  - volume sliders
  - particle quality
- custom world size selectable when creating a new world
- fix delayed sounds
- optimize rendering so we can get 60+ fps in fullscreen not just the default window size (just need to scale up the tiles)


Things that would be cool to have but are not a priority:
- biomes
- multiplayer (probably not going to happen)
  - I could just sync the world data between the games, it seems like it could be a really easy 
    way to do it.
