I'm bored of actually working on the game so I'm just gonna make cheats for it instead
But I'm going to make them external so it's not stupid simple to write them

TODO
 - Fast break
 - Nuker
 - Increased max mana
 - Disable mana cost
 - Ininitate items maybe
 - Mod menu that shows toggled features
 - Mod API that makes adding new cheats easier
